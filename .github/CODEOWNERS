# GLOBAL GOVERNANCE
# -----------------
# The default owner for everything in the repo (optional backup)
* @Ejyke90

# AI GOVERNANCE (RESTRICTED ACCESS)
# ---------------------------------
# Protect the "Brain": No one changes the Agent Personas without approval.
.ai/capabilities/   @Ejyke90

# Protect the "Router": No one changes the Trigger Rules without approval.
.windsurfrules      @Ejyke90

# Protect the "Memory": Protect the Beads configuration (if committed).
.beads/             @Ejyke90

# OPTIONAL: TEAM ALIASES
# If you have a team on GitHub, use the team handle instead:
# .windsurfrules    @RBC/payment-tech-leads

# How to Enforce It
# Just creating the file isn't enough; you must enable the restriction in GitHub settings:
#
# Go to your Repository on GitHub.
# Click Settings -> Branches.
# Edit your protection rule for main (or create one).
# Check the box: "Require review from Code Owners".
#
# Result: If a junior dev tries to change .windsurfrules to make the "Test Agent" less strict (e.g., removing the requirement for AssertJ), GitHub will block the merge until you personally approve the PR.
